      "description": "I'm Micha Davis. I am a software engineer with experience in Unity/C# for PC/Android/XR, and full-stack JavaScript web development. Prior to getting into software development I was an intelligence analyst for the US Army, after which I worked as a freelance illustrator for 10 years. These careers prepared me to stay in constant contact with customers and iterate on their feedback to ensure their ultimate satisfaction with my work--traits I know will lead to success as a software developer.</br> I decided to learn software development because I want to embrace my love for technology and merge that with my artistic design knowledge to produce beautiful, useful, and enjoyable software products. I chose web development because it is the frontier where all the excitement is going to happen in the Information Age. Ideally, I'd use this skill to bring my customers deeper experiences than I could have provided as an artist alone. With this new skill set in my toolkit, the possibilities of what I can accomplish will be limitless.",
