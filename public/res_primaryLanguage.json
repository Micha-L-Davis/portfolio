      "description": "I'm Micha Davis. I am a software engineer with experience in Unity/C# for PC/Android/XR, and full-stack JavaScript web development. Prior to getting into software development I was an intelligence analyst for the US Army, after which I worked as a freelance illustrator for 10 years. I decided to learn software development because I want to embrace my love for technology and merge that with my artistic design knowledge to produce beautiful, useful, and enjoyable software products. With this new skill set in my toolkit, the possibilities of what I can accomplish will be limitless.ðŸŒˆ",
